        Created by Artturi Suominen
        This program uses "brute force" to create a n*n magic square.
        This really straigthforward implementation is rather slow (When n>3 the program
        takes way too much time to finish).

        The program shuffles numbers from 1 to n^2 in the square (matrix) until all rows
        and columns add up to the same sum. There is a special case where the diagonal
        also adds up to the same sum, but that isn't handled in any special
        way by the program.
